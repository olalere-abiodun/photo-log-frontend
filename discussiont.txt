Project Description:
This platform lets event hosts instantly create a shared photo gallery for their events. Once registered, a host receives a unique QR code and link that guests can scan to upload pictures directly from their phones—no app or signup required. The host has full control to view, approve, or delete any uploaded photos, keeping the gallery clean and curated. An admin dashboard provides system oversight for managing events and monitoring content across the platform.
